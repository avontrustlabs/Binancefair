We built a platform for users to quickly check (via API and website) whether a wallet address is safe, i.e. not associated with any scam or fraud 

Our API has two endpoints, (submit and query).Our system is API driven to support all interfaces whether it is a mobile app, bot or web solution, It uses a cloud based API backend that authenticates with wallets by their risk levels and identifies them if they are SAFU or not. It is tracking 2,000+ known scam wallets currently.

The query results should include a score for each address. 100 represents that the address is heavily tainted, or associated with scams, fraud or crime activities, and 0 represents the address being completely clean. Incorporate Blockchain transaction analysis to apply a tainted score for addresses associated with bad addresses.  For example, if a bad (score 100) address transfers to a brand new address, this address should have a relatively high taint score, like 90.

We use a Telegram chatbot website, with a user account management system, plus a built-in business model.The fee can be debited from the query user’s account.The charge a small fee, in crypto, for each query, of which 80% goes to the contributor (submitter) of the information, and 20% goes to the platform for platform maintenance. Incentivize contributors to share bad (hacked or malicious) addresses, together with proof, to help tag more risky addresses
